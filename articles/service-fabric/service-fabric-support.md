# Azure Service Fabric support options

<a id="releasesuport"></a>
## Supported Service Fabric versions.

Make sure that your cluster is always running a supported Service Fabric version. As and when we announce the release of a new version of Service Fabric, the previous version is marked for end of support after a minimum of 60 days from that date. The new releases are announced [on the Service Fabric team blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azureservicefabric/).

Refer to the following documents on details on how to keep your cluster running a supported Service Fabric version.

- [Upgrade Service Fabric version on an Azure cluster ](./service-fabric-cluster-upgrade.md)
- [Upgrade Service Fabric version on a standalone windows server cluster ](./service-fabric-cluster-upgrade-windows-server.md)

Here are the list of the Service Fabric versions that are supported and their support end dates.

| **Service Fabric runtime cluster** | **End of Support Date** |
| --- | --- |
| All cluster versions prior to 5.3.121 |January 20, 2017 |
| 5.3.* |February 24, 2017 |
| 5.4.* |April 17,2017     |
| 5.5.* |Current version and so no end date
