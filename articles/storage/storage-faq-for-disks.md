# Frequently Asked Questions about Azure IaaS VM Disks and unmanaged premium disks

In this article, we'll visit some of the frequently asked questions about Premium Storage.



## Premium Disks â€“ unmanaged

**If a VM uses a size series that supports Premium storage, such as a DSv2, can I attach both premium and standard data disks?** 

Yes.

**Can I attach both premium and standard data disks to a size series that does not support Premium storage, such as D, Dv2, or F series?**

No. You can only attach standard data disks to VMs that do not use a size series that supports Premium storage.


**Are there transaction costs when using Premium Storage?**

There is a fixed cost for each disk size which comes provisioned with specific limits on IOPS and throughput. The other costs are outbound bandwidth and snapshot capacity, if applicable. Please check the [pricing page](https://www.azure.cn/pricing/details/storage/) for details.

**What are the limits for IOPS and throughput that can I get from the disk cache?**

The combined limits for cache and local SSD for a DS series are 4000 IOPS per core and 33 MB per second per core.
